				"What cool things could you do if your car talked to the cloud? That's pretty much all we had to go on when Saatchi LA brought us in. We concepted fresh and exciting ways for vehicles and a website to adapt and make calculated suggestions about new content and programs over the lifespan of your car. They liked our ideas, and we assisted in the design and development of the implementation."

The owner talks to other owners. We came up with ways to make car ownership more effective and rewarding without being hamstrung by process or technical limitations.<br><br>The following slides show just a few examples of our thinking on this project through some early iterations of our recommended design directions."
