				"BC4U is a Denver-based organization that provides free and confidential birth control for anyone ages 12-24. BC4U worked with Legwork Studio to create a cartoonish, playful video about birth control myths. The video exemplifies how the brand is using humor to talk about a sensitive topic with the demographic that most needs information about it. Dig it up, down and all the way around."
