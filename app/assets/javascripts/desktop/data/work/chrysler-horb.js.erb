No one was sure how it should flow so that it was the right amount of challenge vs. retention. So, we built a set of interactive wireframes that allowed us to test the flow while were designing the contest. This allowed us to design something the client was almost completely on board with in the first pass.</p><p><a href=\"http://test.legworkstudio.com/hohb-wires/\" target=\"_new\">Check out the wireframes</a></p>"

The backend API was built using Python on an Amazon EC2 instance. The frontend was entirely comprised of static files (html, js, css) that interfaced with the backend API via AJAX/JSON and was hosted on an Amazon CloudFront distribution. We worked together to build a technical specification that detailed every request and the data being passed back and forth and we collaborated via a Github repository with post-commit hooks for deployment.</p>"

				"text": "<p>We knew this contest would be a target. If you could script against it, you could easily win a car. So, we implemented several security features to make sure that didn't happen. First, we made scripted events much harder to use by requiring real event input. Next, we built a human verification service by asking users to select an image of Ron Burgundy where only the server knew the right answer. Finally, on the server side, we ensured that users could only be logged in in one place, that their score never exceeded the time they spent on the site and required cross site forgery protection in headers for all requests back and forth. As a result, no one was able to cheat.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ronburgundyshumanverificationservice.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ron Burgundy Human Verification Service</a></p>"

In addition to touching Ron, we built in several breaks where users could watch videos or play mini games. By doing well in the games, you could add bonus points to your score which became more valuable the longer you played.</p><p>Here are <a href=\"http://test.legworkstudio.com/burgundy-games/\" target=\"_new\">a few of the mini games</a> that we created for the contest.</p>"
