				"Need an animated video to promote your suite of digital marketing tools? Well, how about a cartoon starring cavemen and farmers! Seriously, this video is all about taking complex problems in an ever changing landscape and making them approachable for really - anyone. We created a rich world and developed some really fun characters that help deliver the message in simple terms, then we brought all to life though a hybrid of 2D and 3D animation, hand painted textures, and cel animated effects."

Next we would draw loosely over each frame in Photoshop to give it a loose hand drawn style, followed by a shadow and highlight pass. Once we had all the scenes laid out and timed correctly we did a final pass over the top of shading, a white wash, and color.</p>"
