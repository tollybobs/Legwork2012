				"With Google Creative Lab’s direction, Legwork developed the user experience, interfaces and game environment, then teamed up with Justin at Mode Set to build Roll It, a Chrome Experiment that reimagines a classic boardwalk game using only the browser on your phone and computer. The browser on your phone lets you aim and roll the ball with a flick of your wrist, while the browser on your computer renders the real time graphics of the Roll It alley with WebGL and Canvas. The two devices communicate via WebSockets. No apps. No downloads. No tokens. All you need is a modern browser."
