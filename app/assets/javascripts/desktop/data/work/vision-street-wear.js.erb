				"This was our first major project as a company. It was one of the first sites to utilize JavaScript based transitions and animations, long before HTML5 became a buzzword. It was a tall order as they already had a world class flash site. So, we focused on adding a plethora of content while maintaining the brand essence that already existed, but built in a standards based environment."
