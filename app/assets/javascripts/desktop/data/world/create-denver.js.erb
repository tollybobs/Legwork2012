				"Create Denver is a week-long celebration of the collective creative industries here in town. Itâ€™s a great outlet for people to really push themselves outside of the typical client-agency relationship. We have participated for a few years now, but one that really stands out was 2011 when we were asked to create and execute a projection mapping of the Ellie Caulkins Opera House for the closing party."
